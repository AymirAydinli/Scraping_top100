Scraping 100 best rated movies on website rottentomatoes.com

### 1.Webpage I am working on is https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/ . It is basically the list of 100 best rated movies on website rottentomatoes.com . 

### 3. I used 2 methods to scrape( Beautiful soup  and  Selenium). It visits every movieâ€™s page and gathers asked data and stores it in a csv file.

### 4. In the output we get essential information of all the movies which are displayed on the first page. Info such as title, critics score, audience score, writer, director, budget, and age rating.
